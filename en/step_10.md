## What next?

### Streamline your User Interface (UI)
Why not take a look at the design of your application now you've run it a few times and improve the UI?

You could take a look at:
+ **Readout clarity:** Are all your readouts clear and uncovered? Do they overlap on long songs?
+ **Operating instructions:** Do you have any controls or features you want to explain to the user?
+ **Sprite design:** Is your visual feedback easy to see? Are your sprites easy to find and click?
+ **Backdrop image:** Does the backdrop make it hard to see the sprites or text? 


### Improve your User Experience (UX)
Why not add some more features to your application to improve the UX?

You could write a script to handle:
+ **Changeable search:** Add a script to change or randomly select genre without having to stop the application
+ **Wider search:** Add a block to randomly select from a list of genres instead of just one
+ **Faster search:** Add a script which plays the sample for less than the full 30 seconds
