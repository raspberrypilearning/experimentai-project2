## Collect song data

Create the code which will find songs on Spotify, collect their audio features data and play them for you to label in your model.

To get started, delete the cat sprite by clicking the little bin icon on its tile beneath the stage.

In the orange `Variables`{:class="block3variables"} menu, select **Make a Variable**.

In the popup, name the new variable genre and select OK.

You will see a few new orange blocks appear in the Variables{:class="block3variables"} menu.

Select **Make a Variable** again, but name this variable the first of your selected audio features from earlier.

Select **OK**.

**Repeat these steps** until your have a variable block for all of your chosen audio features and one for genre:

All of the variables you create will have their blue box ticked by default. This means that they are being displayed with a readout on the stage.

+ Unticking the blue box next to each variable will hide the readout for that variable on the Stage. 
+ You can set the readout style for each variable by double-clicking it on the stage.

--- /task ---

Now that you have all the extensions and variables you need ready to code, you can start making a program to classify your songs. 

To do this, you need to get Scratch to search for a song in one of your genres and play it so you can listen to it. 

--- task ---

Add a `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"} block to your workspace. This is the script that will run the first time we start the project. 

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
```
