## Introduction
In this stage of the ExperimentAI Music quest, you will build the Scratch program that allows you to start playing and classifying music.

If you havenâ€™t done much coding with Scratch before, get up to speed by trying our short warm-up project, [Space Talk](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/space-talk){:target="_blank"}.

### You will:
+ Create or Log in to your ML4Kids account and create a new machine learning model
+ Create a Scratch project which:
+ Searches an online music database by genre and returns random results in that genre
+ Allows the user to classify songs
+ Allows the user to click a sprite that rejects a song entirely and labels it as such in the model
