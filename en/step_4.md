## Make a Scratch application to classify songs

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Your model is ready to train, but to do that you need to create a scratch project that can allow your user to listen to and classify songs for training your model.

### **Your project will:**
+ Search an online music database and play random songs
+ Store the song’s audio features data as variables
+ Send the audio features data back to your model on machine learning for kids

### **Your project should:**
+ Have clearly recognisable sprites for each of your playlist classes
+ Display track and artist information of the current sample 
+ Choose another song after the current one has played
+ Have a way to skip repeated songs without labelling them

### **Your project could:**
+ Have a way to change genre while it is running
+ Display audio features data of the current sample
+ Have a way to collect song names and artist info for each label
+ Have animations that run during playback

On your [**project page**](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/#!/projects){:target="_blank"}, select **Make**:
![Image showing a button reading Make and the explanation 'Use the machine learning model you've trained to make a game or app, in Scratch, Python, or App Inventor'](images/make_button.png)

On the next page, select Scratch 3

**NOTE:** You will get a warning telling you that you haven’t trained a model yet - it’s not a problem; that’s what we are about to do! 

**Select** straight into Scratch by clicking the button:

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
A special fork of Scratch will open in a new tab. When it does, you will see an item in the left-hand menu with the same name as your machine learning project.

The new grey blocks you can see in that menu allow you to access your machine learning model from within your project:

### Add the Spotify extension
--- task ---

Select the blue Extensions button at the bottom left of your screen.

Scroll down the page and select the Spotify extension.

You will see it add several new green blocks, allowing you access to Spotify’s music and database.

You’re now all set up and ready to code the app that will classify songs from the online music database in the next step!

title: Pro tip - Save your work!
---

This special version of Scratch allows you to access your machine learning model, as well as use the music database blocks - **if you try to open your project in another version of Scratch online it probably won’t work**. 

A hack you can use is to save your work to your computer often. Once you have the .sb3 file for your project saved you can open it again later, or on another computer:
+ Go to [rpf.io/mlscratch](rpf.io/mlscratch){:target="_blank"} to get to this special fork of Scratch 
+ Once Scratch opens choose File > Load from your Computer
+ Select your file in the window that appears to get back to where you left off

![Image showing the Scratch file menu with the Load from your computer option highlighted](images/load_menu.png)

Save your work as often as you can to make sure you don’t lose any progress!
